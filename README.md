Statistics about your local music library, based on JAudioTagger
![Preview](preview.png)

## About
In the future, this program will hopefully be able to give you detailed statistics about your music library. But as of now, this is what it can do:

- Scan a root library directory for all audio/music files, including scanning subdirectories.
- Implemented support for flac, alac, mp3, wav and ogg files, though you can add any other format that is supported by JAudioTagger.
- Fetching all of the important metadata. Title, artist, album, date, track, bitrate, sample rate, bit depth/bits per sample.
- Displaying and sorting the frequency of your artists, albums, etc. You can let this program display any of the above mentioned metadata this way.

## Usage
As of now, using this requires you to know Java and edit source code. I'll implement a CLI as soon as possible. In the meantime, don't use this yet or hack around.
